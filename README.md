# Cochlear_implant-visual_demo_of_signal_processing

## About this project
This project develops a tool to demonstrate visually how cochlear implants process audio signals.
Cochlear implants are hearing devices that convert sound into electrical impulses, which are used to stimulate the auditory nerve.
This programme processes the audio signal and displays the outputs visually.

This project requires a microphone, which will pick up audio signals to be processed. The programme then process the audio signal in chunks.
The audio signal is divided into N bands, which each represent a separate electrode of the cochlear implant array. Each electrode processes separate bands of frequencies.

## What is this project used for
This programme was made as an educational tool to allow the processing of a cochlear implant to be demonstrated visually. Each electrode is presented visually and will demonstrate visually if sounds of the corresponding frequency band are detected over time.
